# [Gabriel Veron](https://github.com/GabrielGauss)'s Journey

I am Gabriel, from Argentina based in Italy. I am a frontend developer, designer & illustrator. It biased preference to Frontend development and ux/ui design.
Aside's coding, I love to illustrate, create worlds , make people laugh and I am currently trying to make reading a habit.

## My Journey
My journey in coding started in 2019, when my brother gave me a bunch of web dev tutorials to learn from. 

Things were going well till I lost my laptop and my journey stalled till 2020 when I stumped on CS50x Introduction to computer programming.

After I finished the course in 2021, I had gained skills in web dev and built a a bunch of projects in react.

At the beginning of 2022, I started to learn node, then react, then solidity.

## Currently

Currently I am learning Smart Contracts development on Solidity and trying my possible best to get into Open source and web3 Ecosystem, collaborate and make friends from around the world.
